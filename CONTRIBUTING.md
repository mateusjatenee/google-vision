# How to contribute

Thanks for contributing to google-vision! Just follow these single guidelines:
- You __MUST__ follow the PSR-2 coding standard. More info [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

- You __MUST__ use [feature / topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) to ease the merge of contributions.

- You __MUST__ use the provided [commit message template](.gitmessage), which follows the [rules](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) described by Chris Beams. It can be configured via `composer configure-commit-template` prior to committing.
